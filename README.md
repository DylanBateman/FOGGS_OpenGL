# OpenGL Assignment


## Project Description 
In this project I learnt the basics of 3D rendering and further developed the C++ skills I began learning in the first semester of university.

This project was completed in the second semester of my 'Fundamentals of Game & Graphical Systems' module in the first year of my 'Computer Games Development' degree at Staffordshire University.

## Features
- 3D Rendering of multiple objects
- Animation
- .OBJ file loading
- Texturing
- Materials and Lighting
- Text rendering
- Camera Movement
- User Input


## Goals & Requirements
To develop a coherent C++ application incorporating various 3D graphics techniques with OpenGL & FreeGLUT using the skills and experience built during the ‘Fundamentals of Game and Graphical systems’ module. The application should be able to read and render one or more objects from file, include object movement and user interaction to modify the camera and scene objects.


## Project Thinking
I decided to create two scenes for the project. THe first scene contained implementations of the aspects we learnt within the module, These included the 3D rendering of objects, camera movement, text rendering, user input, lighting & texturing. The second scene included the '.OBJ' file loading which I had to go away and research and implement myself.


## Key Learnings
This project was an introduction into 3D rendering.
- I learnt the basics of rendering using OpenGL  
- Developed my C++ skills further through more learning and experience with the language.
- Appropriate programming standards

Overall, this was a very beneficial project early into my time at university that allowed me to learn the basics of 3D rendering aswell as further my C++ ability and programming standards which aided me further along into my degree.
